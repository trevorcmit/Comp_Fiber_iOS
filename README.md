### Acoustic Fiber App

This repository contains privately-owned code for our implementation of the Acoustic BLE app,
built in Xamarin Forms for deployment to Android, UWP, and iOS. Goals of the app include
detecting, connecting, and reading of Acoustic Fibers and capturing the information they record for
storage and data analysis.
